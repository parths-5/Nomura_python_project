Quant project: part of the assessment process

This repository contains three .py executable files -- 
1. dependencies.py
2. data_download.py
3. strategy.py

Download these in the same directory and execute them as follows:-
1. First, run dependencies.py to install and import all the necessary libraries.
2. Then run data_download.py to download and save necessary data through API. The data gets saved in a new directory named **stocks_data**.  
3. dependencies.py and data_download.py need to be executed only once.
4. Finally, run strategy.py to generate results and plots. /Statistics are printed using the print() function/
5. strategy can be executed multiple times by changing the parameters.
